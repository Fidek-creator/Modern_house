House for teacher to ~~gtfo~~  :smiley:
</p>

Edit: </br>
So as my journey begins with making donut in blender, I've got a course on my studies where I try my best in modelling in 3DS Max without any knowledge. </br>
God bless that blender is free :pray:

## About 
I had to do some model in 3DS MAX because my teacher would not accept any from a different program. </br>
For now when I'm making this file I exported it .max extension to .blend and add some things. </br>
There are two such files in the repository, so you can open them in any program you want.
